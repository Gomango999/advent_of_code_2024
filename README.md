# Advent of Code 2024 
I decided to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) this year as an execuse to practice Rust, and somehow managed to complete all 25 days! It's been a great experience, and helped me polish my skills with Rust, some of it's common libraries, and multithreading and optimisation. 

For the most part, I've tried to keep my code as readable as I can, and have commented the sections that require a little more explanation. 

## Example Usage
To execute the code for day `1` part `a`, run:
```sh
cargo run -- 1 a
```
